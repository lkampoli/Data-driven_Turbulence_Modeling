	abstract     = {Fine-spatial-resolution laser Doppler velocimeter measurements were obtained on one-half of the leeside of an axisymmetric bump in a turbulent boundary layer. The ratio of bump height H and boundary-layer thickness $\delta$ is H/$\delta$ = 2. Three-dimensional separations occur on the leeside with one saddle separation on the centerline that is connected with a separation line to one focus separation on each side. Downstream of the saddle point the mean backflow converges to the focal separation points in a region confined within about 0.15$\delta$ from the local bump surface. The mean backflow zone is supplied by the intermittent large eddies as well as by the near surface flow from the side of the bump. The separated flow has a higher turbulent kinetic energy and shows bimodal histograms in local U and W, which appear to be due to highly unsteady low-frequency meandering motions. Because of the variation of the mean flow angle in the separation zones, the turbulent flow from different directions is decorrelated, resulting in lower Reynolds shearing stresses. Farther from the wall, large streamwise vortices form from flow around the sides of the bump.},

	abstract     = {Despite their well-known limitations, Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) models are still the workhorse tools for turbulent flow simulations in today's engineering analysis, design and optimization. While the predictive capability of RANS models depends on many factors, for many practical flows the turbulence models are by far the largest source of uncertainty. As RANS models are used in the design and safety evaluation of many mission-critical systems such as airplanes and nuclear power plants, quantifying their model-form uncertainties has significant implications in enabling risk-informed decision-making. In this work we develop a data-driven, physics-informed Bayesian framework for quantifying model-form uncertainties in RANS simulations. Uncertainties are introduced directly to the Reynolds stresses and are represented with compact parameterization accounting for empirical prior knowledge and physical constraints (e.g., realizability, smoothness, and symmetry). An iterative ensemble Kalman method is used to assimilate the prior knowledge and observation data in a Bayesian framework, and to propagate them to posterior distributions of velocities and other Quantities of Interest (QoIs). We use two representative cases, the flow over periodic hills and the flow in a square duct, to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. Both cases are challenging for standard RANS turbulence models. Simulation results suggest that, even with very sparse observations, the obtained posterior mean velocities and other QoIs have significantly better agreement with the benchmark data compared to the baseline results. At most locations the posterior distribution adequately captures the true model error within the developed model form uncertainty bounds. The framework is a major improvement over existing black-box, physics-neutral methods for model-form uncertainty quantification, where prior knowledge and details of the models are not exploited. This approach has potential implications in many fields in which the governing equations are well understood but the model uncertainty comes from unresolved physical processes.},

	abstract     = {Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations are widely used in engineering turbulent flow simulations. However, RANS predictions may have large discrepancies due to the uncertainties in modeled Reynolds stresses. Recently, Wang et al. demonstrated that machine learning can be used to improve the RANS modeled Reynolds stresses by leveraging data from high-fidelity simulations [J.-X. Wang, Phys. Rev. Fluids 2, 034603 (2017)2469-990X10.1103/PhysRevFluids.2.034603]. However, solving for mean flows from the improved Reynolds stresses still poses significant challenges due to potential ill-conditioning of RANS equations with Reynolds stress closures. Enabling improved predictions of mean velocities is of profound practical importance, because often the velocity and its derived quantities (quantities of interest, e.g., drag, lift, and surface friction), and not the Reynolds stress itself, are of ultimate interest in RANS simulations. To this end, we present a comprehensive framework for augmenting turbulence models with physics-informed machine learning, illustrating a complete workflow from identification of input features to final prediction of mean velocities. This work has two innovations. First, we demonstrate a systematic procedure to generate mean flow features based on the integrity basis for mean flow tensors. Second, we propose using machine learning to predict linear and nonlinear parts of the Reynolds stress tensor separately. Inspired by the finite polynomial representation of tensors in classical turbulence modeling, such a decomposition is instrumental in overcoming the ill-conditioning of RANS equations. Numerical tests demonstrate the merits of the proposed framework.},

	abstract     = {In this work, we propose using an ensemble Kalman method to learn a nonlinear eddy viscosity model, represented as a tensor basis neural network, from velocity data. Data-driven turbulence models have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional models for providing closure mapping from the mean velocities to Reynolds stresses. Most data-driven models in this category need full-field Reynolds stress data for training, which not only places stringent demand on the data generation but also makes the trained model ill-conditioned and lacks robustness. This difficulty can be alleviated by incorporating the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver in the training process. However, this would necessitate developing adjoint solvers of the RANS model, which can be challenging. Given such difficulty, we present an ensemble Kalman method with adaptive step size to train a neural network-based turbulence model by using indirect observation data. To our knowledge, this is the first such attempt in turbulence modelling. The ensemble method is first verified on the flow in a square duct, where it correctly learns the underlying turbulence models from velocity data. Then, the generalizability of the learned model is evaluated on a family of separated flows over periodic hills. It is demonstrated that the turbulence model learned in one flow can predict similar flows in different geometries.},

A modified feature decomposition method for the spatial orientation feature of the Reynolds stress is proposed. The improved machine learning framework is then applied to the periodic hill database with notably varying geometries.

The inverse modeling step, on its own, can yield valuable insight to the modeler, essentially converting data to information. The machine learning step is a tool to convert information into modeling knowledge. Representative examples are used to describe the methodology and to demonstrate its viability. The first example investigates the modeling of a non-equilibrium turbulent boundary layer, and the second involves the modeling of bypass transition to turbulence. Evidence from these problems emphasizes the utility of the proposed approach in offering new routes to closure modeling in general computational physics disciplines.},

Under these conditions, turbulence may experience a counter-intuitive depletion of the turbulent stresses, which has important implications for modelling and control. Yet, current turbulence theories have been established mainly for statistically two-dimensional equilibrium flows and are unable to predict the reduction in the Reynolds stress magnitude. In the present work, we propose a multiscale model that captures the response of non-equilibrium wall-bounded turbulence under the imposition of three-dimensional strain. The analysis is performed via direct numerical simulation of transient three-dimensional turbulent channels subjected to a sudden lateral pressure gradient at friction Reynolds numbers up to 1000. We show that the flow regimes and scaling properties of the Reynolds stress are consistent with a model comprising momentum-carrying eddies with sizes and time scales proportional to their distance to the wall. We further demonstrate that the reduction in Reynolds stress follows a spatially and temporally self-similar evolution caused by the relative horizontal displacement between the core of the momentum-carrying eddies and the flow layer underneath. Inspection of the flow energetics reveals that this mechanism is associated with lower levels of pressure-strain correlation, which ultimately inhibits the generation of Reynolds stress, consistent with previous works. Finally, we assess the ability of the state-of-The-Art wall-modelled large-eddy simulation to predict non-equilibrium three-dimensional flows.},

Auto-tuning based on curvature, adaptive sampling based on prediction uncertainty, parallel infill, and multiple response criteria are used. Industrial problems are two UQ applications in ship hydrodynamics using high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics for the high-speed Delft catamaran with stochastic operating and environmental conditions: (1) calm water resistance, sinkage and trim with variable Froude number; and (2) mean value and root mean square of resistance and heave and pitch motions with variable regular head wave. The number of high-fidelity evaluations required to achieve prescribed error levels is considered as the efficiency metric, focusing on fitting accuracy and UQ variables. DKG is found more efficient for fitting low-dimensional test functions and one-dimensional UQ, whereas DRBF has a greater efficiency for fitting higher-dimensional test functions and two-dimensional UQ.},

As such, the focus is on incompressible, high-Reynolds-number flows that can be subject to non-equilibrium conditions such as strong pressure gradients, three-dimensionality, and surface roughness and heterogeneity. The Task Group has identified a reduced number of simpler problems in which the above conditions can be studied separately and in controlled environments. These include two-dimensional rough-wall boundary layers under both zero and non-zero pressure gradients, two-dimensional smooth-wall boundary layers subject to pressure gradients, and boundary layers around smooth bodies of revolution and three-dimensional obstacles. An experimental and computational data set is being assembled for further analysis and insight into the flow mechanisms involved, as well as the shortcomings of state-of-the-art models. This paper gives an outlook of the modeling effort within the Task Group, as well its different objectives. These include predicting the effect of roughness in equilibrium conditions; assessing the applicability and/or extension of equilibrium models and predictions to non-equilibrium conditions, in particular when outer-layer similarity is lost; the development of near-wall models based on a reduced-order resolvent framework; and the use of machine-aided methods in closure models.},

A group of the Science and Technology Organization (STO) of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) entitled NATO AVT-349-"Non-Equilibrium Turbulent Boundary Layers in High Reynolds Number Flow at Incompressible Conditions" has recently considered the BeVERLI Hill case. Their goal is to advance the accuracy and range of prediction models for high Reynolds number non-equilibrium boundary layers. This highly collaborative and international group comprised of various academic, governmental, and industrial institutions has performed several Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of the BeVERLI Hill using different grids, solvers, and turbulence models. The resulting solutions and available experimental data are presented in this paper to summarize and highlight key features, sensitivities, and the current predictive capability of RANS for the BeVERLI Hill case. The results suggest important sensitivities to Reynolds number, grid density, iterative converge, solver, and turbulence models. The RANS predictions are seen to be consistent for the fully attached flow on the windward portion of the BeVERLI Hill. Complex non-equilibrium flow physics pertinent to the BeVERLI Hill case, such as rapid changes in the sign of the pressure gradient over the hill top, three-dimensional curvature, and flow separation on the leeward side of the hill lead to notable scatter in the CFD results and discrepancies relative to the experiment.},

A generic submarine Joubert BB2 was selected as a test model, which was modified by Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN). Captive model tests including propeller open water, resistance, self-propulsion, static drift, horizontal planar motion mechanism and vertical planar motion mechanism tests were carried out to obtain maneuvering coefficients of the submarine.

	abstract     = {The high costs associated with the use of research oceanographic vessels and the maturity of the unmanned surface vehicles (USV) makes now possible to develop systems for monitoring coastal areas based on networks of independent USVs. This type of vessels is a valid alternative to conventional vessels, which have a limited mission profile due to their high environmental impact (conventional propulsion systems based on polluting fossil fuels) inhibiting their access to protected coastal regions. Moreover, conventional vessels have high hydrodynamic resistance (limiting the autonomy) producing high levels of noise that can dramatically influence the monitoring equipment shipped: beside the environmental impact reduction, there is also the necessity of low-resistance/low-noise hydrodynamic specification. Consequently, the coastal monitoring (of also protected regions) needs unconventional vessels able to address both the issues related to the environmental impact and the hydrodynamic performance. In this framework, this work aims to characterize the hydrodynamic performance of a system based on USV units able to launch and recover autonomous vehicles of different nature (gliders, AUVs, motor-gliders, wire-guided ROVs), and able to acquire environmental data (in the column water from free-surface to the sea floor), in order to meet the requirements of civil and military applications. The cutting-edge aspects that characterize the USV studied are the hull SWATH type (Small Waterplane Area Twin Hulls) non-conventional, optimized so as to ensure a unique seakeeping and a reduced resistance, along with the propulsion system with propellers in mantle, developed to combine propulsive efficiency and low noise. In the present paper, a SWATH-shaped USV designed for monitoring of protected coastal regions is numerically studied solving the Navier-Stokes equations on the fully appended vessels with several environmental conditions. An accurate hydrodynamic characterization will presented in order to investigate its performances and eventual maneuverability issues.},

The first four statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis), and the probability density function for such quantity of interest (QoI) are computed with two multi-fidelity methods, i.e., the Multi-Index Stochastic Collocation (MISC) and an adaptive multi-fidelity Stochastic Radial Basis Functions (SRBF). The QoI is evaluated via computational fluid dynamics simulations, which are performed with the in-house unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) multi-grid solver $\chi$navis. The different fidelities employed by both methods are obtained by stopping the RANS solver at different grid levels of the multi-grid cycle. The performance of both methods are presented and discussed: in a nutshell, the findings suggest that, at least for the current implementation of both methods, MISC could be preferred whenever a limited computational budget is available, whereas for a larger computational budget SRBF seems to be preferable, thanks to its robustness to the numerical noise in the evaluations of the QoI.},

However, the accurate numerical simulation of turbulent flow around a fully appended maneuvering vessel is a challenging task, because of the geometrical complexity of the appendages and of the complications connected to their movement during the computation. In addition, the accurate description of the flow within the boundary layer is important in order to estimate correctly the forces acting on each portion of the hull. To this aim, the use of overlapping multi-block body fitted grids can be very useful to obtain both a proper description of each particular region in the computational domain and an accurate prediction of the boundary layer, retaining, at the same time, a good mesh quality. Moreover, block-structured grids with partial overlapping can be fruitfully exploited to control grid spacing close to solid walls, without propagation of undesired clustering of grid cells in the interior of the domain. This approach proved to be also very useful in reducing grid generation time. In the present paper, some details of the flow simulation around a fully appended submarine is reported, with emphasis on the issues related to the complexities of the geometry to be used in the simulations and to the need to move the appendages in order to change the configuration of the various appendages.},

Firstly, a numerical simulation of the nonpropelled model without rudder manipulating is accomplished as the basis of this study. The numerical prediction results are in good agreement with the experimental data, which proves the feasibility and accuracy of the direct numerical simulation method. Meanwhile, both model tests and numerical simulation results reveal the strong coupling effect between roll and yaw motions during the underwater ascending process. Based on the above observation and analysis, another two numerical simulations, whose grids are identical with the non-manipulation simulation, are conducted respectively under the condition of rudder steering, i.e., course keeping simulation and self-propulsion simulation. An optimized S surface controller based on conditional determination is designed to manipulate the rudders. As a result, the yaw angle of the latter two simulations is limited within the range of 0.2° and 0.8° respectively, proving the effectiveness of the S surface controller. Correspondingly, the maximum roll angle is reduced by 96% and 70% respectively, which demonstrates that the roll stability is significantly enhanced by improving the course keeping ability of the model. Moreover, it is also proven from the perspective of reverse verification that, the excessive yaw deviation is the root cause of emergency rising roll instability for the situation of incidence angle lower than 30°.},

CFD estimations have been provided by three research institutes by using their in-house codes: CNR-INM using Xnavis, IIHR using CFDShip-Iowa, and CNRS/ECN using ISIS. These allowed an in-depth comparison between different methodologies, such as structured overlapping grids versus unstructured grid, different turbulence models and detached eddy simulations (DES) approaches, and level-set (LS) versus volume of fluid (VoF). The activities were pursued within the NATO AVT-183 group "reliable prediction of separated flow onset and progression for air and sea vehicles," aimed at the assessment of CFD predictions of large three-dimensional separated flows. Comparison between estimations is provided for both integral and local quantities, and for wave-induced vortices. Validation is reported by comparison against the available experimental fluid dynamics (EFD) data. Generally, all the simulations are able to capture the main features of the flow field; grid resolution effects are dominant in the onset phase of coherent structures and turbulence model affects the dynamic of the vortices. Hydrodynamic loads are in agreement between the submissions with standard deviation of about 3.5% for the resistance prediction and about 7% for lateral force and yaw moment estimation. Wave-induced vortices are correctly captured by both LS and VoF approaches, even if some differences have been highlighted, LS showing well-defined and long life vortices.},

The solver is based on the finite volume discretization of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations; main features include a level set approach to handle free surface flows and a dynamical overlapping grids approach, which allows to deal with bodies in relative motion. The baseline code features a hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization, proven to scale when running on order of hundreds of cores (i.e. Tier-1 platforms). This paper deals with latest developments aimed to extend the capabilities of the $\chi$navis software to exploit modern parallel architectures. Scalability properties will be demonstrated for different cases. As example of application, the computation of the flow fields around a submarine in prescribed oscillatory motion and a surface flow around a catamaran in steady drift advancement are presented.},

Several separation distances are considered; data for resistance, sinkage and trim are collected by towing tank experiments for Froude number ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. Monohull tests are also carried out, the analysis of the interference and its dependency on the separation length being the main objective of the paper. Resistance coefficient curves reveal the presence of two humps, the second one strongly depending on the separation length; high interference is observed in correspondence of the second hump. It is found that the narrower is the configuration, the higher is the interference and the speed at which this maximum occurs. To gain a deeper insight into these behaviors, a complementary analysis, in terms of wave field, surface pressure and velocity field is carried out by an in-house unsteady RANS solver. Verification of numerical results is provided, together with validation, which is made by the comparison with both present and other experimental data. Agreement in terms of resistance coefficient is rather good, comparison error being always smaller than 2.2%. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In particular, free running maneuvering simulations are performed both at infinite depth and close to the free surface (snorkeling operation) at a reference speed corresponding to Fr=0.21; the analysis is restricted to three degrees of freedom (3DoF) maneuvers in the horizontal plane. The submarine model is equipped with two different control device arrangements, namely a cruciform and a X rudder configuration. The numerical results are presented in a phenomenological style and are partially validated with the experiments for the cruciform rudder configuration. Main finding highlights the superior turning abilities of the X rudder configuration with respect to the cruciform one. Moreover, it has been observed that, for the condition investigated and for both configurations, the stern appendages provide a destabilizing force only in the transient phase, while it acts as a fixed appendage during the steady turning phase. The study focuses also on the effect of grid refinement on both the maneuvering loads and the resulting dynamic response of the model. The analysis revealed that, at least for the present geometry and test, a rather coarse grid (order of millions of grid points) provides a reliable prediction of both the trajectory and kinematic parameters, but a rather inaccurate hydrodynamic loads estimation.},

The low Mach number large-eddy simulation demonstrated a good prediction of surface pressure coefficient, separation-bubble length, and velocity profiles compared with experiments. The effect of compressibility on the baseline flow is documented and analyzed and is found to increase the separation-bubble size, due to a reduced growth rate. Control is applied just before the natural separation point via steady suction and zero-net-mass-flux oscillatory forcing, and steady suction is shown to be more effective in decreasing the size of the separation bubble and pressure drag for the control parameters investigated. Controlled flow at a compressible subsonic Mach number is applied, and found to be slightly less effective than the same control parameters at low Mach numbers.},

A verification study was performed for one advance coefficient (J=0.71) on four grids and three time step sizes. The study shows that grid refinement has a weak effect on thrust and torque but very strongly affects the wake. The effect of the turbulence model on the wake was evaluated at J=0.4 comparing results with RANS, DES, DDES and with no turbulence model, showing that RANS overly dissipates the wake and that in the solution with no turbulence model the tip vortices quickly become unphysically unstable. Tip vortex pairing is observed and described for J≤0.71, showing multiple vortices merging for higher loads. The wake velocities are compared against experimental data for J=0.74, showing good agreement.

There is accumulating evidence that certain features are flow specific, such as the constants in the log law and the behavior of the very large scales and their interaction with the large scales (consisting of vortex packets).

However, the development of turbulence models has been stagnant for decades. With recent advances in machine learning, data-driven turbulence models have become attractive alternatives worth further explorations. However, a major obstacle in the development of data-driven turbulence models is the lack of training data. In this work, we survey currently available public turbulent flow databases and conclude that they are inadequate for developing and validating data-driven models. Rather, we need more benchmark data from systematically and continuously varied flow conditions (e.g., Reynolds number and geometry) with maximum coverage in the parameter space for this purpose. To this end, we perform direct numerical simulations of flows over periodic hills with varying slopes, resulting in a family of flows over periodic hills which ranges from incipient to mild and massive separations. We further demonstrate the use of such a dataset by training a machine learning model that predicts Reynolds stress anisotropy based on a set of mean flow features. We expect the generated dataset, along with its design methodology and the example application presented herein, will facilitate development and comparison of future data-driven turbulence models.},

However, model uncertainties are still a major obstacle for the predictive capability of RANS simulations. This review examines both the parametric and structural uncertainties in turbulence models. We review recent literature on data-free (uncertainty propagation) and data-driven (statistical inference) approaches for quantifying and reducing model uncertainties in RANS simulations. Moreover, the fundamentals of uncertainty propagation and Bayesian inference are introduced in the context of RANS model uncertainty quantification. Finally, the literature on uncertainties in scale-resolving simulations is briefly reviewed with particular emphasis on large eddy simulations.},

	abstract     = {Turbulence modelling development has received a boost in recent years through assimilation of machine learning methods and increasing availability of high-fidelity datasets. This paper presents an approach that develops turbulence models for flows exhibiting organised unsteadiness. The novel framework consists of three parts. First, using triple decomposition, the high-fidelity data is split into organised motion and stochastic turbulence. A data-driven approach is then used to develop a closure only for the stochastic part of turbulence. Finally, unsteady calculations are conducted, which resolve the organised structures and model the unresolved turbulence using the developed bespoke turbulence closure. A case study of a wake with vortex shedding behind a normal flat plate, at a Reynolds number of 2,000, based on plate height and freestream velocity, is considered to demonstrate the method. The approach shows significant improvement in mean velocity and Reynold stress profiles compared with standard turbulence models.},
